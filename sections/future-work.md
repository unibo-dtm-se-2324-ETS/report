# Future Work

- Replace MD5 password hashing with `password_hash()` and `password_verify()`.
- Refactor remaining direct SQL queries to prepared statements.
- Add automated tests for critical user workflows.
- Introduce proper database migration scripts.
- Add pagination for large expense datasets.
- Add richer charts for long-term category trends.
- Support PDF report export in addition to CSV.
- Improve password recovery with secure email-based flows.
- Add role-based administration if the system grows beyond single-user use.
- Consider a REST API or mobile version in a future phase.

## Closing Remark

The current version already provides a solid academic case study, and these future improvements would move it closer to production-level quality.
