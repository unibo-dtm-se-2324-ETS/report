## Developer Notes

- The application is structured as file-based PHP rather than a formal MVC framework.
- Newer pages already use prepared statements and helper-based reuse more consistently.
- Runtime schema checks simplify local upgrades but are not a substitute for proper migrations.
- Future maintenance should continue moving duplicated SQL and business rules into shared helpers.
