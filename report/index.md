### Project Title
Expense Tracker System

### Author
[Student Name]

### Abstract
The Expense Tracker System is a web-based personal finance management application developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Chart.js. The system allows registered users to record daily expenses, organize them by category, attach receipts, define monthly budgets, and generate analytical reports. In addition to basic expense entry, the project supports multi-currency tracking, recurring expenses, category-level budget monitoring, and dashboard-based visual summaries. The main purpose of the system is to help users monitor their spending habits and make better financial decisions through structured data collection and reporting. The project follows a practical modular structure in which the user interface, database access, helper functions, and reporting logic are separated into different files. This improves maintainability and makes the system easier to extend. Overall, the system demonstrates the application of software engineering principles to the design and implementation of a useful real-world financial management solution.

## Concept

### Introduction
Managing personal expenses manually is difficult, especially when a user wants to review spending patterns over time, compare spending across categories, or keep records such as receipts and recurring payments. Many people rely on notebooks or simple spreadsheets, but those methods are error-prone and do not provide automatic summaries or visual insights.

This project was developed to solve that problem by providing a centralized digital platform where users can record, edit, categorize, and analyze their expenses. The system transforms raw expense entries into meaningful information through dashboards, budgets, and date-based reports.

### Problem Statement
Individuals often face problems in tracking their day-to-day expenses, understanding where their money is spent, and controlling monthly budgets. Traditional manual methods do not provide enough automation, data consistency, or analytical support. Therefore, there is a need for an affordable and easy-to-use web application that can store expense data securely and produce useful reports for decision-making.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a web-based expense management system that helps users record and monitor their personal spending efficiently.

### Objectives
- To provide secure user registration and login functionality.
- To allow users to add, edit, delete, and view expense records.
- To organize expenses using items, categories, notes, and receipt uploads.
- To support multiple currencies for expense tracking.
- To let users define monthly budgets by category.
- To automate repeated spending through recurring expense scheduling.
- To generate day-wise, month-wise, and year-wise reports.
- To present spending insights visually through dashboard charts and summaries.

### Scope
The scope of this project is limited to single-user personal expense tracking after authentication. It covers expense management, report generation, profile management, and budget monitoring. It does not include online payments, banking integration, role-based administration, tax calculation, or mobile-native deployment.

## Design

### System Architecture
The project follows a simple modular web architecture:

1. Presentation Layer
   This includes PHP pages mixed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It is responsible for forms, tables, navigation, and charts.

2. Business Logic Layer
   Shared logic is placed in helper files such as `includes/expense-helpers.php` and `includes/report-helpers.php`. These files handle currency formatting, schema checks, CSRF protection, category utilities, recurring processing, and report formatting.

3. Data Access Layer
   Database communication is handled through MySQLi using the shared connection file `includes/dbconnection.php`. Several modules use prepared statements, especially in newer expense-management pages.

### Main Modules
- Authentication Module
  Covers registration, login, forgot password, reset password, and password change.
- Dashboard Module
  Displays overview metrics, charts, latest expense, category analysis, and budget health.
- Expense Management Module
  Handles add, edit, delete, filter, and export of expense records.
- Item Management Module
  Maintains a reusable list of expense item names.
- Category and Budget Module
  Manages user-defined categories and monthly spending limits.
- Recurring Expense Module
  Automatically inserts scheduled weekly or monthly expenses.
- Reporting Module
  Provides day-wise, month-wise, and year-wise summaries with charts and CSV export.
- Profile Module
  Stores basic user data and default preferences such as currency and default category.

### Database Design
From the codebase, the project uses the following main tables:

#### `tbluser`
- `ID`
- `FullName`
- `MobileNumber`
- `Email`
- `Password`
- `RegDate`
- `DefaultCurrency`
- `DefaultCategoryId`

#### `tblexpense`
- `ID`
- `UserId`
- `ExpenseDate`
- `ExpenseItem`
- `ExpenseCost`
- `Currency`
- `CategoryId`
- `Notes`
- `ReceiptPath`

#### `tblitems`
- `ID`
- `UserId`
- `ItemName`
- `CreatedAt`

#### `tblcategories`
- `ID`
- `UserId`
- `CategoryName`
- `CreatedAt`

#### `tblbudgets`
- `ID`
- `UserId`
- `CategoryId`
- `BudgetMonth`
- `Currency`
- `BudgetAmount`
- `CreatedAt`
- `UpdatedAt`

#### `tblrecurring`
- `ID`
- `UserId`
- `ExpenseItem`
- `ExpenseCost`
- `Currency`
- `CategoryId`
- `Notes`
- `Frequency`
- `StartDate`
- `NextRunDate`
- `LastRunDate`
- `IsActive`
- `CreatedAt`

### Input Design
The system uses form-based inputs for registration, login, adding expenses, filtering reports, updating profile information, and setting budgets. Input controls include text fields, password fields, date pickers, month selectors, dropdown lists, numeric inputs, file uploads, and action buttons.

### Output Design
The system produces outputs in the form of:
- Dashboard cards
- Tables of expense records
- Chart-based visual summaries
- Budget progress indicators
- CSV exports
- Daily, monthly, and yearly report pages

## Development

#<div id="development"></div>

## Development Approach
Based on the code structure, the project appears to have been developed incrementally. The older pages use straightforward PHP and SQL mixed inside view files, while the newer pages introduce helper functions, prepared statements, CSRF handling, better validation, modernized layout styling, and more modular logic. This suggests progressive enhancement rather than a full rewrite.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- PHP for server-side programming
- MySQL for persistent data storage
- HTML and CSS for page structure and styling
- Bootstrap for responsive UI components
- JavaScript and jQuery for frontend behavior
- Chart.js for visual analytics
- XAMPP for local server execution

### Implementation Highlights

#### Authentication
Users can create accounts, log in, reset forgotten passwords, and change passwords after logging in.

#### Expense Processing
The add and edit expense workflows include validation for date, item, amount, category, and optional receipt uploads. Expenses are connected to categories and currencies, which improves reporting accuracy.

#### Budget Tracking
Users can set budgets by category and month. The dashboard compares actual expenses with defined budgets and highlights warning and over-budget states.

#### Recurring Expenses
Recurring entries are stored in a dedicated table. On page access, due entries are automatically inserted into the main expense table based on weekly or monthly schedules.

#### Reporting
The reporting module summarizes expense totals by day, month, and year. Each report includes total amount, highest period, record count, visual charts, and export to CSV.

## Validation

### Testing Approach
The project does not include automated unit or integration tests in the repository, so validation is mainly manual. Manual testing can still be structured around core workflows.

### Sample Test Cases

| Test Case | Input | Expected Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User registration | Valid name, email, mobile, password | User account is created successfully |
| Login | Correct email and password | User is redirected to dashboard |
| Add expense | Valid date, item, amount, category | New expense is saved and listed |
| Edit expense | Update amount or category | Existing expense is updated |
| Delete expense | Valid selected record | Expense is removed from list |
| Add category | New category name | Category is stored successfully |
| Save budget | Category, month, amount | Budget is available in category view and dashboard |
| Add recurring expense | Weekly or monthly schedule | Future expense is auto-generated on due date |
| Generate report | Valid date or month range | Report table and charts are displayed |
| Export CSV | Click export | Data downloads in CSV format |

#<div id="validation"></div>

## Validation Results
From inspection of the code, the project supports the complete main workflow successfully:
- User authentication is available.
- Expense CRUD operations are implemented.
- Filters and CSV export are implemented.
- Budget and category features are integrated with the dashboard.
- Recurring expense automation exists.
- Reporting is implemented in three time scopes.

### Quality Observations
The project shows practical functionality, but validation also reveals areas for improvement:
- Some pages use prepared statements, while older pages still use direct SQL queries.
- Passwords are stored using MD5, which is not secure by modern standards.
- Schema migration logic is triggered at runtime from helper functions instead of using dedicated migration scripts.
- The project has no automated test suite.

<div id="self-evaluation"></div>

## Self-evaluation

### Strengths
- The project solves a clear real-world problem.
- It supports much more than simple CRUD by including budgets, recurring expenses, receipt uploads, multi-currency handling, and visual reports.
- The dashboard offers meaningful analysis rather than only raw data entry.
- The helper-based structure in newer modules improves code reuse and maintainability.
- CSV export adds practical usefulness for users.

### Weaknesses
- Security is inconsistent across the codebase.
- Password hashing uses MD5 instead of stronger modern hashing algorithms.
- Some modules still use direct SQL queries, which increase security risk.
- There is no automated test suite.
- There is no formal migration system for schema evolution.
- The architecture is modular but not fully layered in an enterprise sense.

### Lessons Learned
This project demonstrates that software engineering is not only about making features work, but also about structuring the code, validating inputs, designing database relationships, and planning for maintainability. It also shows how a system can evolve over time from a simple procedural design into a more modular structure.
